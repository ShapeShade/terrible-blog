# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version:
2.7.2

* Configuration: you might want to fiddle with the database.yml and some of the gems should be changed like the node gem could be mini_racer it's node cause my computer didn't play nice with mini_racer

* Database creation:
it's using postgres so normal?

* Database initialization: normal if you need an Admin account uncomment the line in seeds.rb
